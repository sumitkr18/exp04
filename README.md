# Step to be taken:  
   1. Algorithm/Flowchart : 
      1. Project Setup 
   *	Create a new directory for your project. 
   *	Initialize a Node.js application and install required dependencies (express and body-parser). 
   2. Project Structure 
   * Create the project structure with directories for public assets (e.g., CSS) and views (e.g., HTML). 
   3. HTML Setup 
   *	Create an index.html file inside the views directory. 
   *	Design the HTML structure for the signup form, including input fields for username, email, and password. 
   *	Define a form with an action attribute pointing to "/signup" for data submission. 
   4. CSS Styling 
   *	Create a styles.css file inside the public directory. 
   *	Style the signup form, input fields, and submit button for a visually appealing design. 
   5. Node.js Setup 
   *	Create an app.js file. 
   *	Import necessary modules (express and body-parser). 
   *	Create an Express application instance. 
   6. Routing and Middleware 
   *	Configure middleware to parse form data using body-parser. 
   *	Serve static files (CSS) using express.static. 
   *	Define a route for the homepage ("/") to render the HTML signup form. 
   7. Form Submission Handling 
   *	Define a POST route ("/signup") to handle form submissions. 
   *	Extract user data (username, email, password) from the request. 
   *	Implement user registration logic (e.g., store data in a database). 
   *	Respond with a confirmation message to the user. 
   8. Running the Application 
   *	Start the Node.js application using node app.js. 
   *	Access the signup page in a web browser at http://localhost:3000
